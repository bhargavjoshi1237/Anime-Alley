  Yen Press handles the English publication, releasing the sixteenth volume on May 23rd. An epilogue chapter by Hagiwara was added to the manga in July 2021.
  Plot and Premise (Revenge with a Twist):

  The central premise of the anime revolves around Masamune's quest for vengeance. As a child, he was overweight and was cruelly rejected by the beautiful and popular Aki Adagaki. This rejection left emotional scars, and Masamune is determined to make Aki fall in love with him and then break her heart as payback for her past actions. It's a unique and somewhat dark premise for a romantic comedy, and it immediately piques the viewer's curiosity.
  
  Character Development and Complexity:
  
  One of the standout features of "Masamune-kun's Revenge" is its character development. Masamune himself is a multifaceted character who starts as a vengeful teenager but gradually evolves as he navigates the complexities of his feelings for Aki. Aki Adagaki, the so-called "Cruel Princess," is another character whose layers are peeled away to reveal her past trauma and vulnerabilities. This character depth adds richness to the story, making the characters feel relatable and human.
  
  Aki Adagaki: A Complex Protagonist:
  
  Aki Adagaki, as the female lead, deserves special attention. Her character is both intriguing and polarizing. On the surface, she appears to be the archetypal ice queen, callously rejecting anyone who expresses romantic interest in her. However, as the series progresses, we learn about the trauma that shaped her persona. Aki's transformation from the "Cruel Princess" to a more open and compassionate person is one of the most compelling aspects of the story. It's a reminder that people often build emotional defenses as a response to their own pain, and this portrayal adds depth to her character.

<div style="width: 90%;"><p style="font-family: 'Openr'; font-size: 17px;" align="left">I’ve known right from the beginning that it’s just going to be another generic school rom-com as I browsed among the entries for Winter 2017, but something within me wanted to watch this show. The premise made me hope that it’s going to be what I wanted it to be, an actual fulfilling story about revenge through love. As an overweight loser who daydreams about obtaining the perfect body and being popular with girls, I quite find Makabe relatable in his endeavor. I was interested how he is going to carry out his plan on Adagaki, but I guess I was asking too much. Iknow I shouldn’t be this disappointed, but damn this show went nowhere. First of all, the story makes it too convenient for Makabe to get closer with Adagaki. For a cruel princess, she acts very inconsistent. You could say “Oh you know, women are really confusing” but I digress. What makes Makabe different from any other dude she has declined? I’m sure they also used the same tactics Makabe is using. To further add into the convenience, Adagaki’s maid Yoshino agrees to help Makabe in his plan for no really good reason. I mean wow, there are so many things in favor of Makabe but ultimately the greatest hindrance to his plan is really himself. Second, the show has unwanted love interests. Sure, it attempts to create a conflict in which it prevents Makabe’s plan progress but all it does really is derail the main story and put unnecessary complications. Third, why is Makabe’s mom a loli? Fourth, Makabe is too naïve. While this is not necessarily a bad thing as it can serve as a lesson for him to be more careful and considerate, he is still the same overconfident musclehead at the end of the show. His lack of expertise in female interactions is already a bad signal why his plan is challenging to accomplish. Still, he persists in making his plan succeed out of desperation. I would’ve liked it more if some significant development actually happened due to his flaws. Finally, I really had a hard time whether I should even take the show seriously or not. I mean, I liked some of its dramatic moments like flashbacks of Makabe’s past but how both the serious and non-serious moments flow together is mediocre. The execution also somehow lacks to put a punch on supposedly comedic moments, though I appreciate some of its subtle sarcasm. Overall, the show is a decent time waster if you keep expectations to a minimum. There’s no really profound development and it only serves as a failed attempt at making a dynamic rom-com story. However, it’s not downright terrible and a complete trainwreck. It’s just a show that had a strong start but then forgot what it really wants to go for and then tries to make you deal with its complications for the rest of the duration. Maybe I’m just too let down by this show, but maybe I should have never expected anything from it at all.There are a lot of things that factor into creating a well-rounded enjoyable anime title. It’s a combination of the story writing, uniqueness, sounds and animation poured into the creation of the work that produces that golden quality to it. But there’s another category that needs to be touched upon to create a good anime and that is characters. Smart intellectual characters and ones that strive from the common cheap use of stereotypes make a title memorable due to the unique ways these characters are presented through dialogue and interaction. Your characters are the fore-front in the anime, they are the lens the viewer experiencesthe story through, and so having them well fleshed out and smartly written enhances the experience for the viewer. But contrary to my statement listed above, “Masamune-kun’s Revenge” brings nothing smart to the table. In concept the show is about some revenge plan thought out by a prepubescent child after getting rejected when he was about 6 years old, a “l

A New Year is upon us let there be new romance anime. Masamune-kun is your typical romance/ harem anime, but with a twist it has a revenge theme. You have Makabe Masamune who is the hot guy in high school and you have the beautiful cruel girl Aki Adagaki. The plots develops around Makabe driven to take revenge on adagaki for events that happened in the past regarding Makabe falling in love with adagaki. [Story] 8/10 This anime has great story which is easy to follow, but sometimes feels hollow a problem found in some Harem anime. [Art] 9/10 The art was pretty good the characters felt aliveand there was a really great sense of life to be felt from this world. [Sound] 9/10 The sound was great i felt that the op/ending were both amazing. [Character] 10/10 The character development was probably one of the greatest aspects of this anime the interactions that these characters had with one another made it a great watch this winter season. [Enjoyment] 10/10 This anime was also a lot of fun and it also knew not take it self to seriously unless the moment called for some sort of drama inducing sad moments which there were and felt serious which is something really difficult to pull of in this type of series. [Overall Conclusion] 8/10 The winter season brought us a bunch of good anime and i think that masamune-kun no revenge is one of them. The only thing is that it is not an anime for everyone since there are some that hold a grudge towards the harem genre in general, but people that feel the need for some romance, comedy should not hesitate to pick up &amp; start watching Masamune-kun no revenge</p></div>
